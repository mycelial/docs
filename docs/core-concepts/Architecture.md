## Overview of Mycelial Software

### High-Level Architecture

The Mycelial Software architecture is designed for robust and efficient data movement. At its core, it consists of Mycelial Daemons, the Mycelial Control Plane, Connectors and Transforms. Each component serves a distinct role:

- **Mycelial Daemons**: These are responsible for the actual movement of data. They operate in the background, handling the transportation of data to and from various sources and destinations.
- **Mycelial Control Plane**: This serves as the central command and control center for the Mycelial Daemons. It orchestrates the activities of the daemons, managing their workflows, coordination, and monitoring.
- **Connectors**: Functioning as interfaces, connectors enable the Mycelial Daemons to interact with different data sources and destinations. They are specifically tailored to handle various data formats and protocols.
- **Transforms**: These are data processing functions that convert data formats as needed. They are used to ensure compatibility between the source and destination data formats.

### Component Interaction

- **Daemon and Control Plane Interaction**: Mycelial Daemons communicate with the Control Plane to receive instructions and send operational data. This interaction is crucial for sharing available sources/destinations, creating workflows, and error reporting.
- **Daemon and Connector Interaction**: Daemons utilize Connectors to access data sources and destinations. Connectors translate the data and protocol specifics, allowing Daemons to process and move data efficiently.
- **Control Plane and Connector Management**: While the Control Plane does not directly interact with Connectors, it plays a vital role in their management. This includes creating, configuring, and updating Connectors as needed.

This overview provides a fundamental understanding of how Mycelial Software's main components function and interact within the broader system architecture.

## Mycelial Daemons

### Purpose and Functionality

Mycelial Daemons are specialized software entities designed for the movement of
data between diverse sources and destinations. Their primary function is to
ensure efficient, reliable, and secure data transfer, operating silently in the
background close to the sources and destinations.

### Architectural Design

#### Written in Rust

Mycelial Daemons are implemented in Rust, a language chosen for its performance,
safety, and concurrency capabilities. This choice ensures high efficiency in
data handling and robustness in daemon operation.

#### Data Movement Mechanism

The daemons utilize a stream-based approach for data movement, allowing for the handling of large datasets and near real-time data processing. They support various data formats and are capable of both batch and stream processing.

### Security and Authentication Mechanisms

Security in data movement is paramount. The daemons employ encryption for data
in transit and integrate authentication protocols to ensure secure communication
with data sources, destinations, and the Control Plane.

### Error Handling and Logging

Mycelial Daemons are equipped with comprehensive error handling mechanisms to manage and mitigate data transfer disruptions. They maintain detailed logs for system diagnostics, auditing, and performance monitoring, aiding in troubleshooting and optimization.

## Mycelial Control Plane

interact with the Control Plane. This UI offers capabilities for configuration
management, daemon deployment, and system monitoring.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

The Control Plane includes comprehensive monitoring tools for tracking system
performance and health. It supports routine maintenance activities, including
updates and backups, ensuring system longevity and reliability.

### Security Considerations

Security in the Control Plane is multi-faceted, encompassing data encryption,
access control, and regular security audits. It adheres to industry-standard
protocols to safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Connectors

### Definition and Role
Connectors in the Mycelial architecture are components that enable Mycelial Daemons to interface with various data sources and destinations. They play a pivotal role in translating data formats and protocols, ensuring compatibility and seamless data flow.

### Types of Connectors

## Transforms

### Definition and Functionality
Transforms in Mycelial Software are specialized functions integral to the data processing workflow. Their primary role is to modify, process, and standardize data as it moves between sources and destinations, ensuring compatibility and maintaining data integrity.

### Types of Transforms

#### Data Format Conversion
This type of transform changes the data's format to match the destination's requirements.

#### Data Enrichment
Data enrichment transforms add value to the data by including additional information, merging data from multiple sources, or computing new data fields.

#### Data Filtering and Cleansing
These transforms involve the removal of unwanted or redundant data, correction of errors, and ensuring that the data meets quality standards.

### Architecture and Integration

#### Placement in Data Workflow
Transforms are strategically placed within the data workflow, typically after data ingestion by the Mycelial Daemons and before data export to the destination.

#### Integration with Mycelial Daemons
Transforms are tightly integrated with the Mycelial Daemons, allowing for seamless data processing within the movement workflow.

### Development and Customization

#### Custom Transform Development
Mycelial offers a framework for developing custom transforms (coming soon), enabling users to tailor data processing to specific needs and scenarios.
